Case Project 1-1: Personal Attack Experiences
- What type of computer attack have you (or a friend or another student) experienced?
  I have personally feel for those fake free hacks for Minecraft when I was younger. But I figured out how to remove that file from the computer. 
- When did it happen? What type of computer or device was involved? It happened maybe when I was 8 and I wanted to have the better advantage to people, as well as show my friends what I did. 
- What type of damage did it inflict? What had to be done to clean up following the attack?  It was a Torjan virus and I looked at the recent downloads and had task manager open to see why the fans where spinning so fast and found it that way. 
- How was the computer fixed after the attack? What could have prevented it? List the reason or reasons you think that the attack was successful.
  The computer was fine afterwards. What could've prevented it was me not falling for those types of scams. I think it was succesful, I did my best to remove the files from the computer. 
- Write a one-page paper about these experiences.

When I was around 8 years old, I looked up ways how to hack on Minecraft severs for free. I was unaware of my actions and the withdraws of downloading free stuff from the interent. I looked up on YouTube how to get free Minecraft hacks, I clicked the first link and followed the video. Later the computer started to sound funny. I didn't ask my dad to come look at it as I was scared what would happened. So I found another video on how to remove it. Since then, I have been more careful of looking what I'm downloading. If I'm unsure if it's safe I would go to Virustotal and have it check for me. I have also added popup blockers and ad blockers on my computer, and it has been there since. It has helped me prevent clicking on those fake adds.
